# enemy name: The type of enemy, with a sequence of [number, color, spawn type, radius/xpos, theta/ypos] IN THAT ORDER! same omission rules as default values [xpos, ypos]
# number: How many enemies of that type you want to spawn in the wave
# color: What color the enemy should be. "random" can be used instead of a color for a random red or blue. "split" can be used for an even distribution
