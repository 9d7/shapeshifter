# Language Structure
# Comments start with #
# Numeric values can be represented in one of three ways:
# - as a constant: 20
# - as a random range: 15..20
# - as a random choice: 15, 20, 25
# These are allowed for *every* numeric value EXCEPT attack chance, since
# attack chance is handled as a special case.

# bullets (may expand in the future)
# time: the time before the previous bullet to shoot this bullet.
# velocity: the velocity of the bullet, as a multiple of the global bullet velocity
# angle: the ange of the bullet's trajectory, offset from the vector from the attacker to the player
# color: <0.5: enemy color, >0.5: not enemy color. done like this so randomness can be used
# number: amount of bullets of this type
# sequence: if shooting multiple bullets, whether to start them all at the same time (parallel) or one after the other (serial)
# dispatch: whether to shoot this at the same time as the last bullet (with) or after the last bullet is shot (after)
